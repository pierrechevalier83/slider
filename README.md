# slider
A slider puzzle written in Rust using the Piston library

### Build steps
cargo run

### TODO
* main.rs: extract rendering logic and scaling logic
* skin: allow image instead of color gradient
* settings: make configurable
* implement some kind of help functionality so that people know what to do

### Notes
This is mostly an exercise to learn rust... Don't expect to have a lot of fun with it
